Thank you for using ADF Opus 2025!

This update to the program was started in 2025 by Chiron Bramberger. 

The original help file in .HLP format was decompiled and ported to the modern .CHM format with help from the HelpDecoGui2 project found here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/helpdecogui2/

Additional help was providing by this excellent guide:
https://help-info.de/wayback/en/Help_Info_WinHelp/hw_converting.htm

A proper updated credits document still needs to be written. 

What follows below is the original credits information taken from the "About" dialog box from the last original release of v1.2 in the early 2000's.
