<P><B>Usage </B></P>

<P>Use the Batch Converter to convert between uncompressed ADFs and other, compressed formats. The converter can compress ADFs to ADZ format, decompress ADZs to ADF format, decompress DMS' to ADFs and convert DMS' to ADZs. Compression to DMS format is currently not available as this format is subject to copyright restrictions.</P>

<P>Select disk images for conversion using the Add button. These will be listed in the upper window. Remove single files by selecting the file and clicking the Remove  button. The Remove All button will clear all files from the list.</P>

<P>Select the output format using the Output Type buttons. Selecting the Disk Image (ADF) button will convert listed files to ADF format. Selecting the Compressed Disk Image (ADZ) button will convert listed files to ADZ format. </P>

<P>The button for a format that is unavailable for a particular conversion is disabled i.e. The Disk Image (ADF) button will be disabled if an ADF is selected into the list and the Compressed Disk Image (ADZ) button will be disabled if an ADZ is selected into the list. This means that if you select both types, both buttons will be disabled. You should select files of only one type or of different types that can be converted to the same output type. For example a selection of ADZs and DMS' could all be converted to ADFs.</P>

<P>You can reset the Output Type buttons by closing the Batch Converter and reopening it.</P>

<P>Start conversion by pressing the Start button. The converted file's name is removed from the list on completion.</P>

<P>For each attempted conversion, a status message is printed to the Status  window reporting success or failure.</P>

<P><B>Temporary Files </B></P>

<P>When converting between DMS and ADZ formats, ADF Opus creates a temporary, intermediate ADF in the opustemp directory, which is removed after conversion. opustemp is created in the same directory as ADF Opus and is removed when it shuts down.</P>
