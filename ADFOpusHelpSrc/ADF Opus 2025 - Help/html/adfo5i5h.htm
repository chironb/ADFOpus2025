<P><A NAME="idh_uae"></A>UAE, Fellow and ADFs </P>

<P>UAE, the Unix Amiga Emulator is a package which allows the emulation of an Amiga computer on other platforms. Since most platforms can't read Amiga floppy disks, the software emulates the floppy drive as well. It uses files with a .adf suffix as replacement for floppy disks. Adf stands for Amiga Disk File. ADF Opus' reason for being is to allow these disk files to be manipulated directly from Windows.</P>

<P>UAE is available for a number of platforms including Mac, BeBox, NextStep, Amiga, pOS, XFree86/OS2, Acorn RISC PC, Win32 and DOS. Further details can be obtained from one of the UAE web sites. </P>

<P>Another worthy emulator is Fellow by Petter Schau. Fellow is written for MS-DOS, uses the same ADF disk images and is also free. Unfortunately, both the official and unofficial sites are no longer in evidence. Petter seems to have moved exclusively to WinFellow but even this has seen no development for nearly a year. Try WinFellow or this download site:</P>

<P>Some programmes run better on one emulator than the other, or will only currently run on one of them. Some people prefer one over the other, we suggest that you try, and use, both.</P>

<P>Our great thanks must go to the many people who maintain UAE and Fellow on all of these platforms, for helping to keep the Amiga spirit alive. </P>

<P>Rock on!</P>
