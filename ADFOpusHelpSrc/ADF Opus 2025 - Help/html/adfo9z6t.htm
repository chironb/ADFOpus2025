<P><A NAME="idh_properties_ami_pure"></A>Check this box to set the Pure flag for this file. If set for a command, it can be made resident in memory. This allows the command to be run without being reloaded from disk each time, reducing time and memory use. To be made resident, a command should be both re-entrant and re-executable. A re-entrant command can properly support independent use by two or more programs at the same time. Just setting the Pure bit does not make a command or program pure. See the AmigaDOS reference for more information. This bit is best left unchanged.</P>
