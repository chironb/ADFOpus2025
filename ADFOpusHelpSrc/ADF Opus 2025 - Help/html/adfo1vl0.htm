<P><A NAME="1use1ud"></A>Registering File Types with Windows </P>

<P>If you have files in an ADF that you want to open under Windows and you get an error message when you double-click on them, you need to register them with Windows. In order to be able to do this, you must have a suitable Windows programme that handles the type. For example, an AmigaDOS command will never open under Windows as the binary code is incompatible. Files that are specific to a particular Amiga utility may not open. Most other files, such as text, picture and sound files should be fine. If you don't currently have a compatible viewer or handler, you can probably find one on the net.</P>

<P>Windows registers file types according to the last three letters of their name, the three after the dot. This means that you may need to register a particular type of file more than once, if it can have different file suffixes. A common case of this is the text file. Text files can have a huge range of file suffixes. A common one used with text files circulated with Amiga programmes is .readme, which is not generally used on Windows. To register text files with this suffix with Windows, copy one to your Windows file system, or create one, left-click the file once to highlight its icon, hold down the Shift key and right-click on the file. In the context menu that appears will be an item labelled Open with... . Select this. Select your text editor from the list that appears, check the box labelled Always use this program to open this type of file and click OK . If the text editor is not in the list, click Other... and find it manually.</P>
