<P>Introduction </P>

<P>ADF Opus is a management tool for the disk image files used by Amiga emulators. These disk images take the form of a file with .adf suffix. Opus can also access hardfiles, simulated hard-disks-in-a-file, also used by these emulators and can access files stored on the Windows file system but accessed by an emulator as a hard drive. Under Windows NT4, or possibly Windows 2000, it also allows you to access a real Amiga-formatted hard drive attached to your PC.</P>

<P>It allows you to perform most common tasks (like copying, renaming, deleting, etc.) with your ADFs without having to go anywhere near an emulator. Features include long filename support, support for OFS and FFS volumes, high speed file copying, a powerful MDI interface (you can even copy files directly from one ADF to another), access to and conversion between compressed disk image formats and lots of other cool stuff.</P>

<P>Amiga emulators can directly access ADFs compressed with DiskMasher (DMS), an Amiga disk cruncher, or with the industry-standard Gzip compression utility. ADF Opus can extract ADFs compressed by either of these programmes, allowing you to read or modify their contents and can (re)compress ADFs in the Gzip format. Compression to DMS format is not supported as the DMS algorithm is subject to copyright. If this changes, support for DMS compression will more than likely be added. Until then, either use DMS from within an emulator to compress disk images or use the built-in Gzip support, which often creates smaller images. DMS for Amiga is freely available on the net from Aminet .</P>

<P>ADF Opus can create new disk images of both double-density (880 KB) and high density (1.76 MB) disks. It can also create hardfiles up to 512 MB in size.</P>

<P>Best of all it's free, so enjoy it!</P>

<P>For further information about obtaining, setting up and using Amiga emulators see my Amiga Emulation FAQ , the Frequently Asked Questions list for the alt.emulators.amiga newsgroup. This is also a great place to go to ask questions, seek advice and is peopled by a good bunch of Amiga enthusiasts (read fanatics :-) who are happy to help. You are welcome to add your own experiences to the FAQ for the benefit of others.</P>
