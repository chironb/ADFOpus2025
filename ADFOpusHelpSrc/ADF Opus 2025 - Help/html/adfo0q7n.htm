<P>Many users have asked about this feature of Windows NT, 2000 and XP and how to resolve problems connecting and accessing their Amiga hard drives. Bjarke Viksoe, the author of ADF View, has written a small utility to test access to native Amiga hard drives connected to your system. You can use the utility to test whether your Amiga hard drive will be accessible from within ADF Opus.</P>

<P>ADF View also uses ADFLib to access this feature and is implemented as a shell namespace extension. It can access one Amiga HD and one partition. ADF Opus should be able to do at least the same, the difficulties experienced are to do with setting up access under Windows. ADF View's help contains some advice including the need to be logged in with administrator priveleges to be able to access Amiga drives.</P>

<P>ADF View can be used in conjunction with ADF Opus if you do not register the Amiga disk file types with Opus. Once you do this, you will need to re-install ADF View to restore the associations to it.</P>

<P>ADF View and the test utility can be found at http://www.viksoe.dk/adfview/ .</P>
