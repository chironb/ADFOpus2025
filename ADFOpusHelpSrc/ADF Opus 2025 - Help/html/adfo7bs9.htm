<P><B>Usage </B></P>

<P>The dialogue presents the same options as are available for Disk2FDI on the command line and Opus simply builds the command line for you and runs Disk2FDI in a shell. This makes the creation of images from actual Amiga disks convenient and easy and available within Opus itself. You can create ADFs directly from your original disks and manage them within Opus immediately.</P>

<P>DIsk2FDI now runs as a separate process which means that you can now either continue working in Opus while it runs in the background or, if you are creating an ADF, you can choose to open the image in Opus once Disk2FDI has finished. If you choose this option, you will not be able to do anything else with ADF Opus until Disk2FDI finishes. For this reason, the default option is to let Disk2FDI run independently. Whichever option you choose, you still need to close the Disk2FDI shell window once it has finished executing.</P>

<P>It is not possible to run multiple instances of Disk2FDI creating ADFs simply because it requires exclusive access to both floppy drives. It may be possible to run two instances in cases where you are creating images for which only one floppy drive is required, I can't test this. If an instance of Disk2FDI can't access the required resources it will fail politely and you'll just need to close its shell window.</P>

<P>ADF Opus will disable the Disk2FDI menu item under Windows NT, 2K and XP since Disk2FDI itself doesn't work on these platforms. On other versions, make sure that you check Disk2FDI's documentation and that your system meets the requirements for it to operate e.g. you have two disk drives with one being suitable to the media you wish to copy.</P>
