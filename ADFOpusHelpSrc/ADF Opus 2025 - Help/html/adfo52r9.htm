<P><A NAME="81yu65"></A>Opus, File Types and the Shell </P>

<P>ADF Opus now allows you to register Amiga disk file types with Windows Explorer so that double-clicking these files will open them in ADF Opus. You can also select multiple files, using Shift or Ctrl and double-clicking on the final one, and they will all open in Opus. Each file type has its own icon to distinguish it from the others. Right-clicking on a disk file will now give you the option Open with ADF Opus along with the usual selection.</P>

<P>Amiga disk files will be registered for you when you first run ADF Opus after installation i.e. if no registry entry for ADF Opus' preferences exists. In case you haven't uninstalled a previous version or wish to re-register the file types after their association has been changed, you can register files by clicking the Register Amiga file types with Windows Explorer button on the <A HREF="adfo0prn.htm">Options Dialogue</A>. This writes the registry entries required for Windows to recognise the files.</P>

<P>Windows needs to know where to find Opus in order to open these files for you and since the icons are held within ADF Opus' executable file. Therefore, you should also re-register file types if you move ADF Opus to a new directory. Pressing the <A HREF="adfo0prn.htm">Options Dialogue</A> button will rewrite the registry entries with the new path so that all works as it should. You may not see the icons again until you next restart Windows.</P>

<P>In addition, ADF Opus can now be run from the command line, under Windows, allowing its use from file managers etc. This feature was necessary for file associations to work but was also requested by Christian von Krogh. Entering "ADFOpus gaz.adf" will open gaz.adf in Opus. Entering "ADFOpus gaz1.adf gaz2.adz gaz.dms" will open all three files in Opus at once. Entering just "ADFOpus" will open the program by itself. Any amount of white space between file names is acceptable. Anything not identifiable as a disk file will generate an ADFLib error. Identifiable files are still opened.</P>
