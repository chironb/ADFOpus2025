ADF Opus is a free, Open-Source GPL v2 licenced, Windows application that lets you open, browse, and manage Amiga .ADF disk-images natively without an emulator. With Greaseweazle support built-in you can read and write to real floppy disks with the compatible hardware and software. This new 2025 edition by Chiron Bramberger is a refresh and revive of this application for Windows users in 2025!

New features in the 2025 edition include: 
- The power to copy, rename, delete and transfer files directly between disk images and your PCâ€™s filesystem.
- Greaseweazle floppy read/write integration! Read and write your .ADF images to and from real floppy disks using the Greaseweazle hardware and software solution! Make sure you've got the hardware, software and drivers setup for Greaseweazle and then make sure it's installed in: "C:\Program Files\Greaseweazle\gw.exe" and you're good to go!
- Windows Explorer integration for .ADF files. Double-click an .ADF file and it opens in ADF Opus 2025 with the folder that the .ADF came from in the Local File Manager window beside it! This is what originally motivated me to try and revive the original codebase from 2003!
- New disk-label editing. Now you can relabel a disk after it's been created.
- Built-in HEX Viewer to compliment the original Text Viewer.
- The Built-in Bootblock Viewer also allows you to save bootblocks as either hexidecial decoded text or in binary format.
- In addition to the original Install Bootblock feature you can also write raw boot blocks onto the disk without re-calculating any checksums. Great for learning and experimentation such as inspecting a game's custom bootblock or getting a peek at classic virus' bootblocks like the famous MegaMighty SCA Virus!
- Enriches right-click context menus with familiar file-manager commands.
- Supports OFS and FFS volumes and compressed formats (Gzip or DMS).
- Supports batch processing to convert between different Amiga disk formats. 
- UI refresh brings rich icon support, an updated toolbar, and a redesigned look and feel across the application.
- New logo design and application icon design! I tried to create a modern logo with a vintage 80's flare while at the same time honouring the original logo design language and colors!
- Removes unsupported legacy DISK2FDI. This tech requires a PC motherboard with on-board dual floppy disk drive support which is no longer supported on modern systems. This feature is replaced with support for the far more flexible and modern Greaseweazle!
- Legacy help .HLP system removed. A new modern .CHM help system has replaced it with the original context decompiled and recompiled for the modern format.    
- Downloads as a (hopefully) turnkey Visual Studio 2022 solution for effortless cloning, building, and contribution.

I consider this to be all the essentials I wanted to cover in updating this app for 2025! Woot! I hope you find using ADF Opus 2025 to be as enjoyable as I do! It's not perfect but it's got you covered.

I hope managing Amiga disk images just a little bit easier for you!
