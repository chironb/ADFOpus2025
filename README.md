# ADFOpus2025

ADF Opus is a free, GPL v2 Windows application that lets you open, browse, and manage Amiga .ADF disk-images natively without an emulator. This new 2025 edition by Chiron Bramberger restores one-click Windows Explorer integration for .ADF files, enriches right-click context menus with familiar file-manager commands, and removes unsupported legacy elements.  Downloads as a (hopefully) turnkey Visual Studio 2022 solution for effortless cloning, building, and contribution.

I will updating this readme page soon with more details!
